Relentless in his work to the point of neurotic obsession, he thrives on answering the universe's most impenetrable questions. Though his theories often appear opaque and esoteric, Heimerdinger has crafted some of Piltover's most miraculous - not to mention lethal - machinery, and constantly tinkers with his inventions to make them even more efficient.",
