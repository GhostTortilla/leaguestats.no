        "Raising an eyebrow in the face of danger, Akshan fights evil with dashing charisma, righteous vengeance, and a conspicuous lack of shirts. He is highly skilled in the art of stealth combat, able to evade the eyes of his enemies and reappear when they least expect him. With a keen sense of justice and a legendary death-reversing weapon, he rights the wrongs of Runeterra's many scoundrels while living by his own moral code: \u201cDon't be an ass.\u201d",

He might be seen stealing a dance or two, but he only has eyes for one among the crowd. Their moral... discrepancies are no match for the electrifying chemistry between them.",
