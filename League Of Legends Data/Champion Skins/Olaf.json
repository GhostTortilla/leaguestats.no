Hailing from the brutal Freljordian peninsula of Lokfar, he once received a prophecy foretelling his peaceful passing - a coward's fate, and a great insult among his people. Seeking death, and fueled by rage, he rampaged across the land, slaughtering scores of great warriors and legendary beasts in search of any opponent who could stop him. Now a brutal enforcer for the Winter's Claw, he seeks his end in the great wars to come.",
