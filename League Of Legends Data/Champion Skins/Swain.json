Though he was cast down and crippled in the Ionian wars, his left arm severed, he seized control of the empire with ruthless determination.. and a new, demonic hand. Now, Swain commands from the front lines, marching against a coming darkness that only he can see - in glimpses gathered by shadowy ravens from the corpses all around him. In a swirl of sacrifice and secrets, the greatest secret of all is that the true enemy lies within.",
