Destructive, wild, and stubbornly resolute, he existed before mortals walked the Freljord's tundra, and is fiercely protective of the lands that he and his demi-god kin created. Cultivating a deep hatred of civilization and the weakness it brought with it, he now fights to return to the old ways - when the land was untamed, and blood spilled freely - and eagerly battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination.",
