Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great empire of Shurima - merchants, traders, even armed caravans, will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid her and her offspring's hunting grounds. All know that once Rek'Sai is seen on the horizon, death from below is all but guaranteed.",
