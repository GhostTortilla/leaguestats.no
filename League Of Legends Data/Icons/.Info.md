# **Content**
The data inside the Icons file are all IconIDs that I have collected and matched with Names so far. <br>
The list is not complete and will be updated each patch and when new ones are found. <br>

Icons from ID 70'ish to around 500 are where the biggest lack of data is. <br>
Any info on these is appreciated so the list can be as complete as possible.

# **Data Structure**
Data structure is as follows and quite simple:
```json
"IconID": "Icon Name"
```
ALl in all a big list of IconIDs and their corresponding names.
